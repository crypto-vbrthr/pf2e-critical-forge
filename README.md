# PF2E Critical Forge

PF2E Critical Forge consists of two optional user-facing tools built on one always-available Effect Engine:

- **Effect Forge**: a GM interface for building reusable PF2e effects.
- **Critical Forge**: a localized card architecture with PF2e diagnostics, configurable result-chat visibility, and manual GM-confirmed effect application.
- **Effect Engine API**: an always-loaded public API for this and other modules.

## Status

Version `0.5.6-dev` adds the first **manual application workflow** for Critical Forge result cards. A GM can publish an eligible card from diagnostics, keep it GM-blind by default or choose another visibility mode in module settings, and explicitly apply its stored Effect Definition to the recorded source or target Actor. The card revalidates the effect before application, records an audit status, and blocks duplicate application.

The module targets **Foundry VTT 14** with **PF2e 8.1.2 or newer**.

The current engine includes:

- the complete Effect Engine and polished Effect Forge from the `0.4.0` release-candidate line;
- versioned Critical Card and Card Pack schemas;
- transactional Pack Registry and globally indexed Card Registry;
- localized title, description, and effect-name resolution with fallbacks;
- headless filter matching and transparent weighted candidate reports;
- a diagnostic PF2e Context Adapter and GM-only manual workbench for real chat messages;
- localized result cards with configurable `blind`, `gm`, `public`, or `self` visibility;
- GM-confirmed effect application to the stored source or target Actor;
- target re-resolution, target-aware validation, duplicate protection, and application audit flags;
- no automatic roll hooks or automatic card selection yet.

## API access

```js
const api = game.modules.get("pf2e-critical-forge")?.api;

console.log(api.version);
console.log(api.schemaVersion);
console.log(api.effects);
console.log(api.cards);
```

The API is available whenever the module is active. Critical card registries are initialized regardless of whether the optional Critical Forge diagnostic UI is enabled.

## Opening Forge tools

The normal entry point is the **Open Effect Forge** button in the Items Directory. For diagnostics or macros:

```js
game.modules.get("pf2e-critical-forge")?.api.ui.openEffectForge();

// Open an existing Item directly
await game.modules.get("pf2e-critical-forge")?.api.ui.openEffectForge(item);

// Open the manual Critical Forge diagnostic workbench
game.modules.get("pf2e-critical-forge")?.api.ui.openCriticalDiagnostics();
```

## Automated tests

The repository contains dependency-free tests using the Node test runner:

```bash
npm test
npm run test:coverage
npm run quality:check
```

The suite covers the Effect Engine and Forge as well as card normalization, selection, localization, diagnostics, result-card visibility, target resolution, validation, duplicate protection, and manual effect application.

See [`docs/TESTING.md`](docs/TESTING.md) for the test layout and mocking strategy.
